# FYS-STK4155 Applied Data Analysis and Machine Learning - Autumn 2020
## Project 1: Regression Analysis and Resampling Methods
The Project1 folder contains all material related to project 1.

Note that we have chosen to not make any dedicated test runs. This is due to the fact that all the figures found in the Figures folder (the project results) can be reproduced using the available program code directly. For future projects, the plan is to structure this a little bit differently.

The Tex folder contains all files related to the report itself.
